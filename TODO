  * UDDF
    * Add gasdefinitions
    * Add divetrips, done.
    * Add segmentation (otherwise memory usage is enormous on a big gdivelogdb)

  * UDCF (less important)
    * Read 'Preferences' and correctly emit Metric/Imperial for UDCF
       * take imperial and site sep as args in exchange for NOT reading preferences
    * Temperature in appropriate unit, not Kelvin it seems...
    * Some dives are coming out with no profile on divelogs.de.
    * Some dives are coming out with no site on divelogs.de.
    * Gasmixes are faked right now

  * 2.7
    * use argparse instead of optparse

Not having a good tool to import is making it tricky to get UDDF import fleshed out.
