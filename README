Tool for converting a gdivelog database into UDDF and UDCF.

Supports extra xml in notes. For any note field, anything in <xml>...</xml> will be removed from notes, parsed as xml and added to the subtree. Eg. for a piece of equipment,

<xml>
<nextservicedate>
    <!-- device has to be revisioned until May 31st, 2007 (a Thursday) -->
    <datetime>2013-04-28</datetime>
</nextservicedate>
<!-- part needs a yearly service -->
<serviceinterval>365</serviceinterval>
</xml>

will let you set the service date and interval directly into the resulting XML ;

<variouspieces id="eq_13">
   <name>G600 Regs</name>
   <nextservicedate>
      <!-- device has to be revisioned until May 31st, 2007 (a Thursday) -->
      <datetime>2013-04-28</datetime>
   </nextservicedate>
   <serviceinterval>365</serviceinterval>
   ...
</variouspieces>
